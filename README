Design considerations: In order to build a quick rack based api Sinatra chosen
because of its ease of setup and use.


Constraints:


Future improvements:


To run, first do:

  `bundle install`

Then:

  `ruby app.rb`

For example

    endpoint:
      post  `/scooters`

    and a request with body:
      { "scooters": [15, 10],
        "C": 12,
        "P": 5 }

    gets the response:
      { "fleet_engineers" : 3 }
